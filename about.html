<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello,guys My Name is Akriti Kumari
  I'm a B.Sc Mathematics Student and studying in Nirmala College,Doranda Ranchi.
  And currently preparing for one of the toughest exams in India 'CAT'
  Along with that I'm very curious to learn new things so I decided to learn some coding and I end buying the most purchased web devlopment cousre from udemy.

<p>So it's important for me to manage my time like 
  <ul>
    <li>what I eat</li>
    <li>when I sleep</li>
    <li>where I spent my time</li>
    etc.
  </ul>
